Here, we will create the first Jenkins Pipeline that will deploy out a Ghost blog.

In the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item Enter an item name of PipelinePart1, and select Pipeline. Click Ok.

Check the box for This project is parameterized. Click Add Parameter and select Choice Parameter. Give it a Name of action. For Choices, enter Deploy and Destroy, and make sure they are on separate lines. Enter The action that will be executed as the Description.

Click Add Parameter and select Choice Parameter again. This time, name it image_name. Enter ghost:latest and ghost:alpine in the Choices box, making sure they are on separate lines. Enter The image Ghost Blog will deploy as a Description.

Click Add Parameter a third time, and select String Parameter. Give it a Name of ext_port. Set the Default Value to 80. Enter The Public Port as the Description.

Down in the Pipeline section, give a Definition of Pipeline script, and add the following to the Script:

node {
  git 'https://github.com/satyensingh/terraform-docker.git'
  if(action == 'Deploy') {
    stage('init') {
        sh """
            terraform init
        """
    }
    stage('plan') {
      sh label: 'terraform plan', script: "terraform plan -out=tfplan -input=false -var image_name=${image_name} -var ext_port=${ext_port}"
      script {
          timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
              input(id: "Deploy Gate", message: "Deploy environment?", ok: 'Deploy')
          }
      }
    }
    stage('apply') {
        sh label: 'terraform apply', script: "terraform apply -lock=false -input=false tfplan"
    }
  }

  if(action == 'Destroy') {
    stage('plan_destroy') {
      sh label: 'terraform plan destroy', script: "terraform plan -destroy -out=tfdestroyplan -input=false -var image_name=${image_name} -var ext_port=${ext_port}"
    }
    stage('destroy') {
      script {
          timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
              input(id: "Destroy Gate", message: "Destroy environment?", ok: 'Destroy')
          }
      }
      sh label: 'Destroy environment', script: "terraform apply -lock=false -input=false tfdestroyplan"

- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
- Downloading plugin for provider "docker" (2.6.0)...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.docker: version = "~> 2.6"

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.[0m
